# SouthanUK Theme
A theme for my website [SouthanUK](http://www.southanuk.co.uk) which ~~will *eventually* become a WordPress theme~~ Ghost Theme.

###Uses :
 - Yeoman
 - Grunt
 - SASS
 - Bootstrap 3
 - jQuery

###How to run :
```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve 
```
~~Compiled site in dist/~~ ```grunt dist``` has problems at this moment

###Avaliable grunt flags :
 - serve - Starts the development enviroment server 
 - serve:dist - Compiles site for production then starts a server


###TODO :
  - [ ] Refactor the CSS (It's a mess!)
  - [ ] Convert to .hbs
  - [ ] Finalise colours
  - [ ] Remove unnecessary npm packages
  - [ ] Trim Gruntfile.js
  - [ ] Background on the left sidebar? Something space?
  - [ ] HTML5 it 
  - [ ] Remove right sidebar?
